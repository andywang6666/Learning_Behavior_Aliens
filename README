README


To run application, use command: python aliens.py OR python3 aliens.py as needed (Python version > 3.0 needed)


Full procedure file names are structured as ID_PARTICIPANTNUM_ORDER_FullProc.csv


In params.py:

ID              - Participant ID which final procedure files has been created from
PARTICIPANT_NUM - A number from 1 to 4 that is one of the four full procedure files made from FullProc.csv
ORDER           - 'BF' or 'IF' for which study blocking type comes first


Features:

If application crashes or doesn't complete, rerun the experiment with the same procedure file as last time to restart the application where it last left off.
To avoid this and start experiment from the beginning again, either delete the corresponding result file or comment out lines 476 - 479 of aliens.py.
Using another ID, PARTICIPANT_NUM, or ORDER not used before will run a new experiment from the beginning, creating the corresponding results file.


Press 'q' on the keyboard to exit application whenever the application is accepting input.
